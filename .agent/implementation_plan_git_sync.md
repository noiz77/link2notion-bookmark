Implementation Plan - Sync to Git

This plan outlines the steps to commit the recent changes (specifically the updated screenshot) and push them to the remote repository.

## User Review Required
Please confirm if you want to use a specific commit message. If not, I will use "Update project assets and structure".

## Proposed Steps
1.  **Stage Changes**: Add the modified `screenshots/preview.png` to the staging area.
2.  **Commit**: Commit the changes with a descriptive message.
3.  **Push**: Push the commit to the `main` branch on `origin`.

## Verification
- Check `git status` after push to ensure the working tree is clean.
